Okay, so I say this is the first book in the Stormlight Archives, but it's long enough to be the first three books. Now that being said, I never felt bored during this 1000 page adventure. Sure there were some story lines I was more interested in than others at times. And I wanted everyone to get on with their destiny. But what makes this book incredible is the amount of effort that goes into developing deep and interesting characters.

At its heart, this is a classic fantasy story set up. There's a great evil out there waiting. Ancient powers are being reawakened. And the mysteries of a people lost in the ever turning passages of time are being rediscovered.

The world of the Stormlight Archives centers around a group of people known as the Alethi and their war with the Parshendi who assassinated the Alethi king. Everything that happens in the book is centered around this conflict, though Brandon Sanderson lets you know there is plenty more world out there. The thing is, the rest of the world is not just some place referenced in passing, you get the feeling that they are all very real places with very real cultures and histories.

Everything about the world of Way of Kings is intricate. But on top of this sprawling world, Sanders places a couple of relatively straightforward story lines. The stories are good in themselves and filled with interesting characters, but they really succeed in drawing you deeper into the mystery of the _real_ conflict - whatever that is.

> The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon.

There are many books left unwritten in this series, but so far it is setting itself up to be the best fantasy series I have ever read.
