  He found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life, where every
  path was an improvisation and a considerable part of one's waking life was
  spent watching one's feet.

I'm 26 now, which makes me about a decade late on when most people read this book. And maybe that is why I found it to be a fun, but not particularly interesting read.

I did genuinely enjoy this book. I think the boys were interesting and even compelling characters. I think the descent into madness felt like the smooth and slippery slope it was meant to be. I felt the chaos of it all in the way Golding described everything.

I just didn't find much to talk about in there?

I say that knowing this is one of those books that high school english classes love to teach. I was expecting some commentary on society but I didn't really feel like I got one. Instead I got a specific set of circumstances that resulted in some young children going crazy. Now there might be something there about how we all sit on this precipice of sanity and it doesn't take much to push us over the edge when left to our own - but I didn't really feel like that was the point it was making.

In the end, I left it with the same though as the naval officer who comes to save them.

> I should have thought that a pack of British boys would have put on a better show than that?
