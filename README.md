# Descolada - My Personal Blog

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8425a66f-eb83-4ddf-bda5-b9ab53dceeeb/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms-ci/deploys)

**Note:** This blog was built using [this awesome quick start template](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) from Netlfiy and GatsbyJS

This repo contains an example business website that is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org):

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## What is this?

This is my (Ian Mundy) personal website. It's a place for me to keep track of the things I am interested in and to continue to do front end web development regardless of what I am currently working on professionally.

### Why [Gatsby?](github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)

Because [React](github.com/facebook/react) is an incredible framework, I personally like it, and I enjoy working with it in my free time. 

### Why Netlify?

Netlify is doing awesome things for website hosting and deployment (and in so many other areas as well). I cannot say enough about how awesome of a project it is to work with. The developer experience has been incredible. I can't speak to what it is like at an enterpise level, but for a personal website I would give it a **strong** recommendation

## CONTRIBUTING

If for some reason you want to contribute to my personal website, just open an issue or send me a PR :) I'm also always happy to chat about development with anyone who is interested.
